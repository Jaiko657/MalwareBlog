            <h1>Introduction:</h1>

            <p>
                Welcome to my project blog, where I explore the world of malware creation. As a first-year student in Queen's University Belfast's Computer Science Challenges module, I decided to embark on this project because of my interest in creating malware that
                is undetectable by security software. I have spent a significant amount of time researching the techniques and tools used in malware creation, and I have gained a considerable amount of knowledge in this area. In this blog post, I will
                introduce you to my projects and help explain the difficult concepts that I have learned.
            </p>
            <h1>Why Malware Creation:</h1>
            <p>
                Learning about malware creation can be a valuable experience for anyone interested in computer science, cybersecurity, or programming. By exploring the techniques used to create malware and the methods for making it undetectable, you can gain a deeper
                understanding of how computer systems work and how to protect them from attacks. Malware creation also requires problem-solving skills and creativity, as you need to come up with new ways to bypass security measures and avoid detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, working on a project like this can help you develop your programming skills, as you need to write code that is both effective and stealthy. You can also learn how to use tools like MetaSploit and nim, which are widely used in the cybersecurity
                industry. By following this guide, you can build upon the work I have done and continue to explore the exciting world of malware creation.
            </p>

            <h1>Main Focuses:</h1>
            <p>
                My project focuses on creating malicious tools that are undetectable using bypass techniques and obfuscation. The techniques and tools I have developed can be used for educational purposes or for further exploration in the field of cybersecurity. By following
                this guide, you will gain insight into the techniques used by cyber-criminals to create undetectable malware. Furthermore, you will learn about the timeline of Anti-Virus detection methods and how they have been bypassed. there is also
                a guide on how to set up a development and testing environment for malware creation. There are also multiple small guides that can be followed to get into the world of malware creation. I have also a guide on how you would create your
                own modular malware to help learn how malware developers implement different techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also included explanation on different critical parts of windows operating system and how they can be implemented into your own malware. Understanding these ideas such as the WINAPI, processes and handles is an important part of developing malware.
                Learning about these ideas can also help with general windows programming for someone that is used to python or C# etc.
            </p>

            <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
            <p>
                This project has been a fascinating journey into the world of malware creation. I have gained valuable knowledge in techniques and tools used to create undetectable malicious tools. By implementing different techniques in multiple languages I have gained
                knowledge in the realm of not just malware but also the lower level of compilers and the windows operating system. I hope that there is enough resources here to fast track the understanding of how malware works and how security measures
                act together in order to catch the majority of malware.
